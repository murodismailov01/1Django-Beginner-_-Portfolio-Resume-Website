                    <hr>
                    <p>3 months after writing my first Hello World Hello program on April 1th 2022 (While working in
                        the marketing department) I had convinced my boss to let me take a stab at building a better
                        version of the outdated laboratory management system my company was running on.</p>
                    <p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine.  My newbie self was
                        nov in charge of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousand of clients</p>
                    <p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that jumps before can talk myself out of doing something scary </p>
